# CustomSVM_Implementation
Explore an in-depth, Python-based implementation of hard margin SVM from scratch using the cvxopt solver. This repository features custom coding of RBF, Linear, and Polynomial kernels, thoroughly exploring SVM concepts and their practical applications in the realms of machine learning and data science.


# SVM From Scratch in Python

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation of hard margin Support Vector Machines (SVM) from scratch using Python. It focuses on developing custom SVM kernels, including Radial Basis Function (RBF), Linear, and Polynomial, and employs the `cvxopt` library for solving the quadratic programming problem inherent in SVM.

## Key Features
- Custom implementation of RBF, Linear, and Polynomial kernels.
- Detailed explanation of SVM theory and kernel functions.
- Usage of `cvxopt` solver for quadratic programming in SVM.
- Functions for calculating Hessian matrix and solving for Lagrange multipliers.
- Demonstrations of SVM on sample datasets with visualizations.

## Prerequisites
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- cvxopt

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required libraries:
```
pip install numpy matplotlib cvxopt
```

## Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook to walk through the SVM implementation and examples:
